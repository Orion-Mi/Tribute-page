                <li><span>1950</span> He moved to Kenya where he worked various jobs including labourer, clerk, and salesman. While in Kenya, Obote became acquainted with Kenyan nationalist leaders working for Kenyan independence and joined Kenya African Union.</li>

                <h3>Independence and Beyond</h3>
                <li><span>1962</span> Apollo Milton Obote became the first Prime Minister after a joined coalition with the Buganda royalist party, Kabaka Yekka. He assumed the post on 25 April 1962, appointed by Sir Walter Coutts, then Governor-General of Uganda. On 9 October 1962, Uganda became independent under his leadership.</li>
                <li>The alliance between Obote and Kabaka Yekka, however, was short-lived. The conflict escalated between the two groups and resulted in Obote sending troops under Idi Amin to attack Buganda. Kabaka Mutesa II fled to Britain.  For his efforts, Amin was appointed chief of the Ugandan army.</li>
                <li><span>1966</span> In an effort to solidify his rule, Obote introduced a new constitution that abolished all the kingdoms and other remnants of federalism in the country. The new constitution also established an executive presidency, which Obote assumed while continuing to serve as prime minister.</li>
                <li><span>1971</span> While attending a meeting of the British Commonwealth, he was overthrown by Idi Amin.</li>
                <li><span>1979</span> Idi Amin was ousted by Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles.</li>
                <li><span>1980</span> Uganda was governed by an interim Presidential Commission. At the time of the 1980 elections, the chairman of the commission was a close associate of Obote, Paulo Muwanga. UPC won the elections and Obote was elected head of state and ruled for 5 years.</li>
                <li><span>1985</span> he was forced out of office, a guerrilla war against his rule under General Titi Okello and Brigadier Bazilio Olara-Okello. After his second removal from power, Obote fled to Kenya and later settled in Zambia but continued to play an active role in the UPC.</li>
                <li><span>2005</span> He died while undergoing medical treatment in Johannesburg, South Africa on October 10, 2005.</li>
